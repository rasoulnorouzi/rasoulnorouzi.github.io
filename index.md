I have the privilege of being supervised by [Professor Caspar J. van Lissa](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/resume/), [Dr. Bennett Kleinberg](https://bkleinberg.net/), and [Professor Jeroen Vermunt](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/jeroen-vermunt). In my research, I have a strong interest in identifying important phenomena in the field of social science and deriving testable hypothesis by AI systems. By combining advanced NLP algorithms and Graph Neural Networks techniques, my goal is to make valuable contributions to the progress of social science research and discover fresh perspectives.

I am also interested in web application design, particularly utilizing JavaScript, React, and Node.js to create user-friendly interfaces for AI systems.

With a commitment to continuous learning and a passion for innovation, I strive to deliver meaningful results.

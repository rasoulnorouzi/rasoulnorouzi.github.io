<b style="color:rgb(135,135,235);"> About Me:</b> I am an enthusiastic researcher who is currently working towards my PhD at Tilburg University's Methodology and Statistics department. I have the privilege of being supervised by [dr.Caspar J. van Lissa](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/resume/), [dr. Bennett Kleinberg](https://bkleinberg.net/), and [Professor Jeroen Vermunt](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/jeroen-vermunt).  I work on theory development and refinement in the social sciences, utilizing natural language processing methods. My approach combines large language models for data extraction with graph neural networks for data analysis.

I am also interested in web application design, particularly utilizing JavaScript, React, and Node.js to create user-friendly interfaces for AI systems.

With a commitment to continuous learning and a passion for innovation, I strive to deliver meaningful results.

Me in a nutshell: Book addict <br/>
